Version 0.3.1:
	New Features:
		The Options Header can now be "rolled up" so there's more space for the visualization
		Pie - Now has a "doughnut" option 
		Added a Green-Blue color scale
		Data sets can now have a "default view" which will be automatically set when that dataset is loaded
		All visualizations now have a legend

	Fixes:
		Mosaic - Removed option to turn off exploded mode to make moot display issues in non-exploded mode.
		Contrasting colors actually contrast now, when there are fewer than 7 levels in the color scale.
		Text color is white when displayed on a dark background across all visualizations, not just in Table
		Will now read the state correctly from the URL (e.g. if you refresh, you'll be in the same place you left off)
		Back/forward now work correctly
		Header and Visualization now scroll to top when the visualization or dataset changes
		
	Other Changes:
		Speed-up in date parsing - will be most evident in large data sets with lots of repeated dates
		DataInfo - Now shows total number of rows in dataset
		Pie - Text labels on pie wedges can be turned off
		Shows messages (e.g. "Calculating...") during long operations


Version 0.3.0:
	New Features:
		New visualization: Pie chart
		Added a "Count Unique" Aggregator that counts the number of unique values that an attribute has in a data set

	Other Changes:
		Major rewrite to clean up UI code.  Much easier to maintain and expand now.

Version 0.2.2
	New Features:
		Calendar - Months are labeled
		Calendar - Tooltip showing the aggregated value for a particular date
		
	Fixes:
		Can now filter date attributes (e.g. Date At Least 2014-10-12)


Version 0.2.1
	New Features:
		Data Info visualization which just displays info about all the columns in the data set
		Calendar - Can be saved as an image

	Fixes:
		Fixed errors when loading settings from a URL that's set to correlogram (or other visualizations that don't have a Pivot Panel)
		Back/forward previously functioned only every other button press
		Speed-up due to a removed Redraw that occured when Advanced Options were open (for visualizations that don't need to vertically resize)
		
	Other Changes:
		Correlogram - Color scale now defaults to "None"
		Calendar - Renders considerably faster by using native Date calls instead of moment.js (seconds with large calendars)
		Visualizations can now hide the Filter Panel and the Advanced Options Panel should they want to
	
	
Version 0.2.0
	New Features:
		New Visualization: Correlogram integrated instead of separate app
		New Visualization: Calendar view
		Scroll bar now appears only on visualization and header stays pinned to top
		Changelog appears when version is upgraded
		Visualizations can be embedded into other websites (Pass the NoInterface URL parameter to hide the interface)
		Mosaic - Mouseover tooltip with cell info (option that can be turned off)
		Mosaic - Option for Size which defines size (relative to available screen real estate) of mosaic plots.  
				 Size option includes "Auto" mode that decides size based on whether there is active horiz and/or vert tiling.
		Correlogram - much faster (2x or more) than previous Correlation app
		Correlogram - Includes an Automatic Size or Full Size option for the plots
		Correlogram - Includes option for dark background
		
	Fixes: 
		After using Mosaic mode, AggregatorType select options were displayed in a horizontal list instead of a vertical list
		Errors happened if one of a visualization's advanced option wasn't present in that visualization's hash list
		Redraw was getting called twice when hash was programmatically updated b/c it was triggering the hash changed event which also redraws
		Visualization size is adjusted when Advanced Option panel are shown/hidden to prevent blank space at bottom of the screen.
		Unique values for each attribute are now cached, speeding up processing by several seconds for long data sets.
		Mosaic - Cell spacing was inconsistent in exploded mode
		Mosiac - Color by row colored by visible row not overall row (i.e. colors incorrect when there are removed, empty cells)
		Mosaic - Move tooltip position relative to cursor to keep it on screen
		Mosaic - Columns height overflows container in non-exploded mode
		Table - In Auto Format mode, should display as number instead of percent when AggregatorType is Count
		Table - When showing as Percent of Row/Col and using Count aggregator, col/row totals were appearing as percents rather than decimals
	
	Other Changes:
		Visualizations' DrawInit, Init, and UnInit functions can now be left undefined if they're not needed
		Adding/removing visualizations is simpler (Just requires including in the HTML file; no other setup needed)
		AggregatorPanelInit checks Visualization.AggregatorPanel.Aggregators for a list of aggregators to display
		Mosaic - Exploded mode now set by default
